degrees-of-seperation.py - Script that uses BFS to find the minimum degrees of seperation between any two nodes in a graph. Tested using a dataset from Kaggle on Marvel characters which shows, for each marvel superhero, all of the superheroes they appeared alongside at any point in the comics.

movie-recommendations.py - Script that uses a basic version of Item-based collaborative filtering to find recommended movies for a particular user based on ratings data. Tested using a dataset from movielens.org which detailed fake user ratings for movies.
